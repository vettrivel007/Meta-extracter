# Meta-extracter
Extract metadata (including EXIF data) from image files such as PNG, JPG, and JPEG.  EXIF metadata including GPS coordinates, camera model, exposure settings, and more.

## Features

- Extract basic metadata (format, size, mode) of the image
- Extract EXIF metadata such as camera make/model, focal length, ISO speed, and more
- Convert GPS coordinates from EXIF metadata into decimal format for easier geolocation

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vettrivel007/Meta-extracter.git
   cd Meta-extracter.py
   ```

2. **Create a Python virtual environment:**

   You can use `venv` to create an isolated Python environment for running `Meta-extracter`.

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
   .\.venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install Pillow exifread
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the script:**

   After cloning the repository and installing the dependencies, you can run `Meta-extracter` by providing the path to an image file.

   ```bash
   python3 Meta-extracter.py
   ```

   The script will prompt you to enter the path of the image file you'd like to analyze.

2. **Example:**

   ```
   Enter the path to the image: /path/to/image.jpg
   ```

   The tool will output both basic metadata and EXIF metadata, including any GPS data if available.
